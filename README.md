### What I learned

This time i decide to start using a css methodology like BEM, Atomic CSS, DOCSS, etc.

I learn [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/), because in [The State of CSS 2020](https://2020.stateofcss.com/en-US/technologies/methodologies/) was the first on usage.

I really like it and i want to see how many code can i re use in my next project.
